+ Prerequisites change every year maybe. subject to yearly change:
Cornell change in 2031
NCSU change in 2030,
Michigan ... added physiology
U Minnesota changed the requirement for Math, chemistry and Biology courses, such as no longer require Microbiology or Zoology but change to a wide range of Biology course higher than General Bio, 

+ some schools only accept course from a 4-year college/university, and some univs only accept certain lower level courses to be taken at a community college, such as UC Davis accept all but three upper division courses (biochem, genetics, and physiology) taken at a community college; some schools such as U Wisconsin, accept prerequisites completed a any two or four-year regionally accredited institution. It's hard to find upper level courses in community colleges.
  
+ quarter vs. semester: some schools require two quarters for the one-semester required course (e.g. U Minnesota's requirement for organic chem, biochem, etc), some only require one quarter. Mostly schools required 3 quarters for the two-semester course.

Use transfer course checklist to verify prerequisites.
if the minimum score is C- all the courses (semester or quarter) should meet this requriement
