At the process of application, students have to often make decisions, such as "do I need to take GRE?", "Should I take this offer or wait for another one?", "Should I apply to graduate school or work first?"...

At TEssay, we have applied decision theory to help our clients make rational decisions.

Our interest in Decision Theory came from my colleague's and my personal life experiences. After making irational decisions and being punished for it, we became interested in learning how to make rational decisions. This led us to study this field and apply it to our personal decision making. As we have more clients at TEssay, we found that for many students, not only they need assistance with the preparation of the application, more often than not, they also need guidance on how to make a rational decision or choice. Even though we have been providing this consulting service to our former clients in the package of services they purchased, now we want to make it an individual service for people who need it specifically.
